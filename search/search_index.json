Purpose of the Package The purpose of this package is to calculate the intensity of photoluminescence from point defects in solids with method described in New J. Phys. 16 (2014) 073026. It also calculates and plot other relevant quantities like partial Huang Rhys factor, inverse participation ratio etc. Getting Started The package can be found in pypi. You can install it using pip . Installation pip install defectpl Usage Following is an example usage with the data stored in tests/data for NV center in diamond. from defectpl.defectpl import DefectPl band_yaml = \"../tests/data/band.yaml\" contcar_gs = \"../tests/data/CONTCAR_gs\" contcar_es = \"../tests/data/CONTCAR_es\" out_dir = \"./plots\" EZPL = 1.95 gamma = 2 plot_all = True iplot_xlim = [1000, 2000] defctpl = DefectPl( band_yaml, contcar_gs, contcar_es, EZPL, gamma, iplot_xlim=iplot_xlim, plot_all=plot_all, out_dir=out_dir, ) API TODO Contribution Contributions are welcome.
